# AI Fake News Detector

This project is an end-to-end AI system to detect fake news. It uses advanced transformer models like BERT or RoBERTa for text classification. Below are the steps to build and deploy the application.

---

## 1. Collect and Prepare the Data

### Datasets:
- **LIAR Dataset**: Contains short statements labeled with their truthfulness.
- **FakeNewsNet**: Includes real and fake news articles with social context.
- **Kaggle Fake News Dataset**: A collection of labeled news articles.

### Preprocessing Steps:
- **Text Cleaning**: Remove HTML tags, URLs, special characters, and stop words.
- **Tokenization**: Use Hugging Face tokenizers to split the text.
- **Label Encoding**: Convert categorical labels into numerical format.
- **Splitting Data**: Divide into training, validation, and test sets.

## 2. Train the AI Model

### Model Selection:
- Choose a transformer model such as **BERT** or **RoBERTa**.

### Fine-Tuning:
- Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer using Hugging Face.
- Add a classification layer on top of the transformer.
- Define training parameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, and epochs).
- Train the model using the training dataset.

### Evaluation:
- Use the validation dataset to tune hyperparameters.
- Test the model with metrics like:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
- Analyze the confusion matrix to identify misclassifications.

## 3. Backend Development

### API Development:
- Create the following endpoints:
  - **/analyze**: Accepts text input and returns prediction results.
  - **/feedback**: Allows users to submit feedback on predictions.

### Model Integration:
- Load the fine-tuned model into the backend server.
- Optimize performance by ensuring the model loads only once.

### Security:
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Sanitize inputs to avoid injection attacks.

---

## 4. Frontend Development

### User Interface:
- Design a simple interface for:
  - Inputting news articles or URLs.
  - Displaying prediction results with probability scores.
- Add features like:
  - **History**: View previous analyses.
  - **Feedback**: Allow users to report incorrect predictions.

### Responsiveness:
- Ensure the application works seamlessly across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

---

## 5. Testing and Deployment

### Testing:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure proper communication between frontend and backend.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Gather feedback from potential users.

### Deployment:
- Host the application on a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku).
- Monitor the system for bugs or performance issues post-deployment.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites:
- Install Python and necessary libraries (Hugging Face Transformers, Flask/Django, etc.).
- Set up a cloud environment for deployment.

### Steps:
1. Download and preprocess the datasets.
2. Fine-tune the transformer model.
3. Build and integrate the backend APIs.
4. Develop the frontend user interface.
5. Test the entire system.
6. Deploy the application to a cloud server.
